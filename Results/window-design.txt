For the sketch, one refinement that I thought was rather obvious was to move the "Add Movie" button off of the top right corner of the entire frame and into the top right corner of the Movie Info panel on the left, where the user will give information regarding the movie he had just added. I also labeled the search parameters in the Sort/Filter panel as tags, making the filter a bit more versatile; and gave the movies tag lists that could be editable. The tag categories can be collapsible in the Sort/Filter panel and the list of tags in the Movie Info panel can be edited like the rest of that panel.
