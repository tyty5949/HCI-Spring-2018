    Jane has just recently flown over to the United States. On her second weekend here, she has finished all of her homework and chores so decides to spend some alone time on Friday night. She has seen some bizarre things since coming to the United States and is curious about some of the cultural aspects of the United States. She goes to iFilm and searches for an "Everyday Life" genre, similar to "Slice of Life" in Japan. However, she does not find it. Then, she goes to the search bar and types in some of the things she has witnessed throughout the week. She finds an interesting movie and decides to watch it.
    After waking up bright and early to go to a coffee shop to chat with other like minded old men, Rick makes his way back to his house just before lunch so he can try to decide which western he wants to watch after lunch. He loads up iFilm on his computer following strict written instructions left by his daughter, he clicks on the genre button and selects western. He then starts to browse, going movie by movie, taking note of the year it was made and the actor in it, as well as reading the entire description twice just to make sure he didnâ€™t miss anything. After looking at around 30 movies, he finally decides to pick one. Having spent just over an hour browsing, he goes makes lunch then comes back and starts the movie while he eats. About halfway through he takes a quick siesta and when he wakes up the movie is over. Since he really did want to see it, he starts it back over from the last place he can remember and finishes it.
