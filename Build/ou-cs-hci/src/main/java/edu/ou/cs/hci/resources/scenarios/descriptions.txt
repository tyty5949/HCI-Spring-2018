    After seeing that great action movie the other day, they, the teen, wants to stay up late and watch another so they load up iFilm around 11pm. They may search for the movie they just saw and use the related movie functionality to find another one to watch. They may quickly scan for pictures which look the best and then click on one opening up its description page. They will then look at the ratings displayed from rotten tomatoes and imdb and find that it’s not actually a very good movie. They may choose to watch it anyway or go back and find another movie related to the original. Either way, they will just be looking for a movie which got good reviews, maybe has an actor they know, and has a eye catching picture. After ending up on a movie which got good reviews and has an artsy photo, they will click play watch the movie late into the night, and maybe another, and maybe another after that.
