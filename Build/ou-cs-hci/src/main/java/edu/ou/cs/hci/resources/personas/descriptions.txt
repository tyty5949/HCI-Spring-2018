Jane is an exchange student from Japan on a scholarship. Although she was outgoing back in Japan, the language barrier prevents her from being herself. She still attempts to make conversation with many of her classmates, who have complimented her on her English. She likes watching movies and documentaries as a tool to help improve her English. 
Persona two is Rick, after only being successful in that one TV show Andrew Lincoln changed his name to his character, who after retiring has decided he wants to watch just about every western ever made. He is not up on all this new age technology but likes to believe that he can figure it out since “all them young wippersnappers can”. Being from a media background himself, he enjoys watching the films with old actors who he never got to know.
Person three is the stay at home mother in her 30s and 40s that has a to-do list that is always full of new things every day. When the kids are at home, they like to watch cartoons, which gives her time to do the laundry and dishes uninterrupted. When her husband gets back from work, they all like to sit down together and watch a family friendly movie.
